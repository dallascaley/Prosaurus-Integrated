i have an app in vue.js which is being served to an https location, how do i get rid of the Not Secure warning in the browser?

ChatGPT said:

To get rid of the "Not Secure" warning in the browser for your Vue.js app served over HTTPS, you'll need to ensure that your app is being served with a valid SSL/TLS certificate. This is what ensures that the connection between the client (browser) and the server is secure. Here are the steps to resolve the issue:


1. Obtain a Valid SSL/TLS Certificate

You can get a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). There are two common ways to obtain a certificate:

  Free SSL (Let's Encrypt): You can use Let's Encrypt to get a free SSL certificate. It’s trusted by most browsers and easy to set up.

  Paid SSL: You can purchase an SSL certificate from a provider like Comodo, DigiCert, or GoDaddy.


2. Install the SSL Certificate on Your Server

Once you have the certificate, you need to install it on your web server. Here's how to do it for common server types:

Apache:

  Place the certificate files (certificate, private key, and intermediate certificates) in your server.
  Modify the Apache configuration file (typically httpd.conf or within the virtual host configuration) to include:

 
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/certificate.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/private.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/your/chainfile.pem

  Restart Apache.

Nginx:

  Place the certificate files on your server.

  Modify the Nginx configuration to use the SSL certificate:

    server {
      listen 443 ssl;
      server_name yourdomain.com;

      ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;
      ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;
      ssl_trusted_certificate /path/to/your/chainfile.pem;

      # Other server configurations...
    }

  Restart Nginx.

Other Servers: If you're using other server software, you can find guides for SSL installation specific to that platform.


3. Force HTTPS Redirection

Ensure that all HTTP traffic is automatically redirected to HTTPS. This can be done by adding a redirect rule in your server's configuration.

  For Apache:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName yourdomain.com
      Redirect permanent / https://yourdomain.com/
    </VirtualHost>

  For Nginx:

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name yourdomain.com;
      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }


4. Check for Mixed Content

  Even if you have a valid SSL certificate, if any resources (like images, scripts, or stylesheets) are being loaded over HTTP, you’ll get a mixed content warning. You can fix this by ensuring all external resources are loaded over HTTPS:

  Update all the URLs in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to use https:// instead of http://.

  If you're using Vue.js, make sure that API requests, for example, are made to https:// endpoints.


5. Clear Browser Cache

  After making these changes, clear your browser's cache and refresh the page. The warning should be gone if everything is set up correctly.

  Once you've completed these steps, your site will be served over HTTPS, and the "Not Secure" warning should be gone.

I would like to use Let's Encrypt.  Currently my site is only hosted locally on my vm and not through Apache or Nginx but via the npm run dev command which is connected to vite in my package.json file.  Can I use Let's Encrypt in this case?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can use Let's Encrypt even when you're running your Vue.js app locally with Vite (via npm run dev), but you'll need to do some additional steps. Let’s break down how you can achieve this with your setup.

Challenges

  Vite's Dev Server: Vite's dev server is designed for development purposes and doesn't have SSL/TLS enabled out of the box.

  Localhost: Let's Encrypt certificates are generally for publicly accessible domains, so you won’t be able to directly request a certificate for localhost. But you can set up a publicly accessible domain (or use a tool to expose localhost to the internet) and then request the certificate.

  Steps to Set Up Let's Encrypt SSL for Your Local Vue.js App


  Step 1: Set Up a Public Domain or Expose Your Localhost

    To use Let's Encrypt, your local VM or server needs to be accessible from the internet. You have two options for this:

    Option 1, do it using DNS the proper way:

    Use a Public Domain: If you have a domain name, you can configure your DNS records to point to the public IP address of your VM.

      Update DNS Records: You’ll need to point the A record for your domain to your VM’s public IP address. For example, if your domain is yourdomain.com, create an A record in your domain’s DNS settings pointing to your server.

    Option 2, Do it the bullshit way:

    Expose Your Localhost Using a Tunnel: If you don't have a public IP address or want a quick solution for local development, you can use tools like ngrok or localtunnel to expose your localhost to the internet temporarily. These tools will give you a public URL that you can use for obtaining a Let's Encrypt certificate.

    ngrok:

      ngrok http 3000
      
      This will give you a public URL like https://<random-string>.ngrok.io, which you can use to request an SSL certificate.

    localtunnel:

      lt --port 3000

      This will also give you a public URL to use.

  Step 2: Install Certbot on Your VM

    You need Certbot to automate the SSL certificate creation process.

    Install Certbot: If you're running Ubuntu or a similar system, you can install Certbot via the package manager:

      sudo apt update

      sudo apt install certbot

    Ensure You Have HTTP Access: Make sure your app is reachable via the public domain or ngrok/localtunnel URL so that Certbot can complete the challenge.

  Step 3: Obtain the SSL Certificate Using Certbot

    Once your server is publicly accessible via HTTPS (either with a domain or through a tunnel), you can use Certbot to request an SSL certificate.

    Run Certbot’s web server plugin to request a certificate. If you're using a domain:

      sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com

    If you're using a service like ngrok/localtunnel, you'll have to make sure that the tunnel URL is accessible and you can specify the URL like so:

      sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d <your-ngrok-url>.ngrok.io

    Certbot will handle the ACME challenge, verify ownership of the domain, and issue the certificate.

  ---------

  Step 4: Set Up Vite for SSL

    Once you have your certificate, you can configure Vite to use it in the development environment.

    Find Your Certificate Files: Certbot will store your certificates, typically in the /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/ directory, with the following files:

      fullchain.pem: The full certificate chain (used for the server certificate).

      privkey.pem: The private key for the certificate.

    Configure Vite to Use SSL: Update your vite.config.js (or vite.config.ts if you're using TypeScript) to enable HTTPS using the certificate files:

      import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
      import fs from 'fs';

      export default defineConfig({
        server: {
          https: {
            key: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem'),
            cert: fs.readFileSync('/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem'),
          },
          port: 3000, // or any other port you'd like to use
        },
      });

    Run Your App Over HTTPS: Now, you can run your app with npm run dev and access it securely via HTTPS using the Let's Encrypt certificate.

      npm run dev

    our app should now be served over HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

  Step 5: Automate Certificate Renewal

    Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. To automatically renew them, you can set up a cron job to run the following 
    command to renew your certificates:

      sudo certbot renew

    Add it to your crontab to renew certificates automatically (e.g., every day at midnight):

      sudo crontab -e

    Add the following line to run the renewal command:

      0 0 * * * certbot renew --quiet

    This will ensure your certificates are always up-to-date.

Summary

While you can't directly use Let's Encrypt for localhost, you can expose your local environment via a public domain or a tunneling service like ngrok/localtunnel. Once exposed, you can request a certificate using Certbot, configure Vite to use the SSL certificate, and run your Vue.js app over HTTPS securely. Make sure to set up automatic certificate renewal to avoid any interruptions.

How do i determine the public IP address of my VM?

ChatGPT said:

To determine the public IP address of your virtual machine (VM), there are several methods you can use depending on where and how your VM is hosted. Below are some common methods for various environments.

1. Using the Command Line (Linux-based VMs)

  If you have SSH access to your VM, you can use a command to find the public IP address. Here are a few options:

  Using curl to check an external service: You can use a service like ifconfig.me or ipinfo.io to determine the public IP address. Run the following command in your VM's terminal:

    curl ifconfig.me

    Or:

    curl ipinfo.io/ip

    This will return the public IP address of your VM.

  Using wget: Alternatively, you can use wget if curl is not installed:

  wget -qO- ifconfig.me

2. Check Through Your Cloud Provider's Console

  If you're using a cloud service (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud), the public IP address is usually listed in the console/dashboard for the VM.

  Amazon Web Services (AWS):

  Go to the EC2 Dashboard.

    In the "Instances" section, find your VM (EC2 instance), and you'll see the public IP listed in the details of the instance.
    Microsoft Azure:

  Go to the Azure Portal.

    Navigate to your VM under "Virtual Machines".
    In the VM overview, you'll see the public IP address associated with your VM.

  Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

  Go to the Google Cloud Console.

    Under "Compute Engine", go to "VM instances".

    You'll see your VM listed with the external IP address in the instance details.

3. If You Are Using a Virtual Machine on Your Local Network (Home Setup)

  If your VM is hosted on a local network (like in your home or office), you may not have a public IP address unless you have configured port forwarding or your network uses a static public IP. In this case, you can check your router's configuration:

  Login to your Router: Access your router's admin page (usually at 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).

  Find the WAN/Public IP: Look for the WAN (Wide Area Network) or Public IP address in the status or network settings. This is the public IP address used by all devices on your local network, including your VM.

  If you're behind a router and want to expose your VM to the internet, you would need to set up port forwarding on the router to forward traffic from your public IP to your VM's local IP address.

4. Using hostname (for Cloud Providers)

  If your cloud VM has a public DNS hostname (for example, ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com), you can simply use the following command to resolve its IP:

    hostname -I

  This will return the internal private IP address, but you can also check DNS to determine the corresponding public IP.

5. If You're Behind a NAT or VPN (Virtual Private Network)

  If your VM is behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) or VPN, then you might need to check the public IP as seen from outside your network:

  Check a public IP service: Visit a site like WhatIsMyIP.com or iplocation.net. This will show the public IP of the device you’re using to access the internet, which might be the same as your VM if you're behind NAT.

  Using your VPN provider’s dashboard: If you're using a VPN service to expose your VM, check the VPN provider's dashboard to see the public IP assigned to your connection.

Summary

For most VMs in the cloud, simply check the public IP address in the VM's console or dashboard of your provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.). If you're on a local network, use external tools like curl or wget to check your public IP, or check your router's WAN settings. If you're behind a NAT or VPN, you may need to check external services or your VPN dashboard to find the public IP.
Let me know if you need further help depending on where your VM is hosted!

On Godaddy I would like to point the A record of my domain to my VM's public IP address which I determined is 96.41.85.126.  How do i do that exactly. I see five input fields which are Type, Name, Value, TTL and seconds

ChatGPT said:

To point the A record of your domain to your VM's public IP address on GoDaddy, you will need to modify the DNS settings in your GoDaddy account. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you configure the A record correctly:

Step-by-Step Process to Point the A Record to Your VM’s Public IP Address:

Log in to Your GoDaddy Account:

Go to GoDaddy’s website.
Log in with your credentials.
Navigate to DNS Management:

Once logged in, click on your username in the top-right corner and select "My Products".
Find the domain you want to edit under the "Domains" section.
C
lick on "DNS" next to the domain you want to update. This will take you to the DNS Management page.
Locate the A Record Section:

On the DNS Management page, you’ll see a list of DNS records for your domain.
Look for an existing A Record. If one exists for @ (your root domain), you’ll be modifying it. If not, you can create a new one.
Add or Modify the A Record:

Type: Choose A from the dropdown menu (since you’re pointing to an IPv4 address).
Name: Enter @ if you want to point your root domain (yourdomain.com) to your VM’s IP address. If you want to point a subdomain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com), enter www.
Value: Enter your VM's public IP address: 96.41.85.126.
TTL (Time to Live): You can leave this at the default value (usually 1 hour or 3600 seconds), or you can set it to a lower value like 600 (10 minutes) if you want DNS changes to propagate more quickly.
Seconds: If there's a separate input field for "Seconds," this will be the TTL value, which you can set to 3600 (1 hour) or adjust as needed.

Here's an example for both the root domain and the www subdomain:

For the root domain (yourdomain.com):

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 96.41.85.126
TTL: 3600
For the www subdomain (www.yourdomain.com):

Type: A
Name: www
Value: 96.41.85.126
TTL: 3600

Save the Changes: After filling in the appropriate values, click the Save button at the bottom of the DNS record list. The changes should take effect within a few minutes to a few hours, depending on your TTL settings.

Verify the Changes: After saving the changes, you can verify that the A record is correctly pointing to your VM's IP address by using a DNS lookup tool like:

MXToolbox DNS Lookup
What's My DNS
Just enter your domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com or www.yourdomain.com) and see if it resolves to 96.41.85.126.

Example of What It Should Look Like:
Type	Name	Value	TTL

A	@	96.41.85.126	3600
A	www	96.41.85.126	3600

That’s it! Now your domain (or subdomain) should point to your VM's public IP address.



You said:

I don't know if i set this up correctly.  I have added the A record as you indicated above, but my assumption would be that I could browse to the site like this: https://prosaurus.com:5173  is this not correct?

ChatGPT said:

You're on the right track, but there are a few things to clarify and address regarding how things should work:

Understanding Port Numbers and Browsing to Your Site

When you set up an A record to point your domain to your VM’s public IP address (e.g., 96.41.85.126), the A record is responsible for resolving the domain (like prosaurus.com) to your VM's IP. However, port numbers like :5173 are additional information that tells the browser which specific service or application to access on the server.

By default, HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443. When you specify :5173 in your URL (like https://prosaurus.com:5173), you're telling the browser to connect to port 5173 on your server, which is typically used by Vite's dev server.

What You Need to Do

Here’s how to ensure you can access your site properly, whether you’re in development or want it publicly accessible:

1. Accessing the Dev Server (Vite)

If you're running Vite’s dev server on your local VM, and you’ve mapped the port to 5173, you will indeed need to access it via https://prosaurus.com:5173. However, there are a few things to check:

Vite Configuration: In your vite.config.js, make sure the server is configured to accept connections from external IPs, not just localhost (which would limit it to only being accessible from the VM itself).

Example configuration in vite.config.js:
js
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0', // Listen on all network interfaces
    port: 5173,       // Default Vite dev port
    https: true,      // Enable HTTPS if desired
  },
});
This will make Vite listen on all interfaces, not just localhost, which means it will be accessible externally.
Firewall and Security Settings: Ensure your VM’s firewall is configured to allow traffic on port 5173. On Linux-based systems, you may need to open the port manually using ufw or other firewall tools:

  sudo ufw allow 5173

Public IP Exposure: Ensure that your VM is exposed to the internet with the correct public IP. You mentioned setting the A record, so make sure that the domain prosaurus.com correctly resolves to the public IP 96.41.85.126.

2. Accessing Your Site Without Port Numbers (Optional)

For a smoother user experience and to remove the need to specify the port number, you can configure your server to use standard HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). This would typically require additional steps like:

Using Nginx or Apache as a Reverse Proxy:

You can set up a reverse proxy to forward HTTP/HTTPS requests to Vite’s server running on port 5173 (or any other port you choose). This would allow you to access the site as https://prosaurus.com without specifying the port.
For example, with Nginx, you would set it up as a reverse proxy like this:
nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name prosaurus.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5173; # Forward to Vite dev server
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
This configuration forwards any requests to prosaurus.com to your Vite dev server running on port 5173.
Configuring HTTPS: You can also set up Let's Encrypt (or a self-signed certificate for local use) to serve your site over HTTPS. This requires additional steps like installing Nginx or Apache and configuring SSL certificates.

3. Testing and Debugging

Check DNS Propagation: After updating your A record, DNS changes can take some time to propagate globally (anywhere from a few minutes to several hours). You can check if your domain prosaurus.com is pointing to the correct public IP (96.41.85.126) using DNS lookup tools like MXToolbox.

Verify Port Accessibility: You can check if port 5173 is open and accessible from outside your VM using online tools like CanYouSeeMe or by using telnet or nc to test the connection on that port.

bash
Copy
Edit
telnet prosaurus.com 5173
If it’s accessible, you should be able to connect.

Summary

To access your Vite development server:

Make sure your Vite config listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and is accessible externally.
Ensure port 5173 is open in your firewall.
Use the URL https://prosaurus.com:5173 to connect directly.
(Optional) Set up a reverse proxy (using Nginx or Apache) if you want to remove the need for the :5173 port in the URL and access the site as https://prosaurus.com.
If you want your site to be available on the web without specifying a port number, consider setting up a reverse proxy and HTTPS with a standard port (80/443).


Log of what I have actually done:

I am trying to get a ssl cert via Let's Encrypt.  This is what I have done so far.

1) figured out what my public IP address is by running this command on my VM

  curl ifconfig.me

  Which gave me 96.41.85.126

  Note, I am suspicious that this will change after i reboot the VM

2) Went to Godaddy and added an A record with this IP

  Note, i'm currently just trying to get a the vue.js version of the site working (just the front end) which is currently running locally on port 5173

3) Ensure my VM's firewall is configured to allow traffic on port 5173
  
  sudo ufw allow 5173

Note, there's a bunch of other things that i need to do, but at this point I would expect to be able to see my site at https://prosaurus.com:5173 and I cannot.  This could be caused because of the 24-48 hours required for DNS propagation or i could have done something wrong.  What do you think?
