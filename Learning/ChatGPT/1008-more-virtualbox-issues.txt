ChatGPT:

Thanks for providing the log! From the entries, it looks like there are several errors related to the state of the virtual machine (VM) and some other issues that might explain why the VM struggles to boot on the first attempt. Let's break down the key errors:

Key Error Messages:
VBOX_E_INVALID_VM_STATE:

This is one of the most common errors you’ll see in the log. It indicates that VirtualBox is trying to modify or interact with the VM, but the machine is in an invalid state. The error occurs in various states like "PoweredOff," "Running," "Stopping," or "Starting."
Specifically, this line appears multiple times in the log:

ERROR [COM]: aRC=VBOX_E_INVALID_VM_STATE (0x80bb0002) aIID={300763af-5d6b-46e6-aa96-273eac15538a} aComponent={MachineWrap} aText={The machine is not mutable (state is PoweredOff)}

This suggests that VirtualBox is trying to perform operations on the VM when it’s not in the correct state for that action (e.g., modifying a powered-off VM).

Possible Causes:

VM state corruption: If the VM's state is corrupted or if VirtualBox fails to correctly track the state of the VM, you could see these errors when VirtualBox tries to modify it (such as saving settings, snapshots, or performing other operations).

Improper shutdowns: If the VM was improperly shut down (e.g., forcefully powered off or the host crashed), VirtualBox may be in a confused state, leading to this error.

VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND:

The log also includes an error indicating that a required object could not be found:

ERROR [COM]: aRC=VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND (0x80bb0001) aIID={70401eef-c8e9-466b-9660-45cb3e9979e4} aComponent={ExtPackManagerWrap} aText={No extension pack by the name 'Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack' was found}

This error suggests that VirtualBox could not find the extension pack needed to handle certain features, like USB devices, virtual networking, or others that require the extension pack.

Possible Causes:

Missing or corrupted extension pack: The extension pack may not be installed or properly configured on your system. This can lead to problems with certain VM functionalities like USB support.

VBOX_E_IPRT_ERROR:

This error occurs when VirtualBox encounters an issue related to internal processing (IPRT stands for "Internal Process Runtime").

ERROR [COM]: aRC=VBOX_E_IPRT_ERROR (0x80bb0005) aIID={300763af-5d6b-46e6-aa96-273eac15538a} aComponent={SessionMachine} aText={Saved screenshot data is not available (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED)}, preserve=false aResultDetail=-37

This error suggests that a saved screenshot file is either missing or incompatible with the VM's current state. It's less likely to be the direct cause of the boot issue, but could indicate that VirtualBox is having trouble loading or restoring certain saved states.

VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND (UEFI NVRAM):

Another significant error:

ERROR [COM]: aRC=VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND (0x80bb0001) aIID={5bfd8965-b81b-469f-8649-f717ce97a5d5} aComponent={NvramStoreWrap} aText={The UEFI NVRAM file is not existing for this machine.}

This error indicates that VirtualBox is looking for a UEFI NVRAM file, which is used to store the UEFI settings (like boot order). The absence of this file can prevent the VM from booting correctly, especially if the VM is configured to use UEFI for booting.

Possible Causes:

UEFI NVRAM corruption: If the NVRAM file is corrupted or missing, it could prevent the VM from booting. This file is crucial when using UEFI for booting.

Recommendations for Fixing These Issues:

Check the VM's state: Try manually ensuring the VM is in a clean state (either powered off or not in a suspended state) before starting it again. You might want to forcefully shut down the VM and ensure it is properly powered off via the VirtualBox GUI.

Check VirtualBox Extension Pack:

Reinstall the VirtualBox Extension Pack to resolve the missing extension issue:

Go to the VirtualBox Extension Pack download page.
Install the extension pack corresponding to your VirtualBox version.
Restart VirtualBox and try starting the VM again.

UEFI NVRAM Issue:

You may need to reset or recreate the UEFI NVRAM settings for the VM. Try the following:

In VirtualBox, go to the VM settings, and under System → Motherboard, change the boot order to something else (like disabling UEFI or switching to BIOS).

If you must use UEFI, try removing the current NVRAM file and let VirtualBox recreate it when you next start the VM. You can find the NVRAM file in the VM's folder and delete it (make sure the VM is powered off).

General Maintenance:

Update VirtualBox to the latest version if you haven't already.

Consider checking the VM's disk image (VMDK or VDI) for errors, especially if VirtualBox is having trouble with certain operations like saving state or loading configurations.

By fixing these issues, the likelihood of the first boot failure should decrease. Let me know if you'd like more help with any of these steps!


Log of what i did:

Updated VirtualBox to the latest version

Effect: now it boots full screen instead of having to be minimized then maximized.  Also it booted, like the first time.  We will see if this fixes the booting issue going forward.

2/21/2025 update

Problem is still not solved, had to boot twice.
