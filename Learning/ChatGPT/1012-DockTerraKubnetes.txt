I have an application which is written in vue.js on the frontend and express.js on the backend.   Currently i run the application with a custom start script that runs npm run dev and npm run devStart in the appropriate folders on my VM.  The VM is also configured with an nginx reverse proxy and the actual DNS of the url and all the networking is configured to point the production version of the site to my VM (so the site is really only up when i happen to start my local VM).  this is fine for development, but I need to start thinking about production.  Here is my thoughts on how to do this:

1) Start with docker, figure out how to get the application set up in a docker image or collection or whatever.

2) Next, research Terraform and figure out how to set up infrastructure using that tool (probably in AWS)

3) Thirdly, figure out how to use Kubernetes for scaling because I figure this system will eventually need it.

Does this all make sense so far?

Yes, your approach makes perfect sense and is a solid plan for moving from a local development setup to a more scalable and production-ready environment. Let’s break it down:

1. Dockerizing the Application

  Why Docker? Docker is an excellent choice because it will allow you to package your frontend and backend applications (Vue.js and Express.js) into isolated containers that can run consistently across different environments. This helps eliminate the "it works on my machine" issue.

  Next Steps:

    Frontend (Vue.js): You can create a Dockerfile that installs Node.js, builds your Vue.js app, and serves it (using something like Nginx for production).

    Backend (Express.js): Similarly, you can create a Dockerfile for your Express app that installs dependencies, builds your app, and runs the Node.js server.

    Multi-container setup: You might want to use docker-compose to define and manage both containers together for local development (you can set up a docker-compose.yml file).

2. Setting up Infrastructure with Terraform (AWS)

  Why Terraform? Terraform will allow you to codify your infrastructure, making it reproducible and easier to manage over time. AWS is a good choice for hosting production apps because of its scalability, security features, and wide range of services.

  Next Steps:

    Define AWS Resources: Use Terraform to define resources such as EC2 instances (for running Docker), S3 (for static files), VPC, security groups, and IAM roles.

    RDS: If you need a database, you can use Terraform to provision an RDS instance and configure your app to connect to it.

    Auto-scaling: Terraform can also help you set up auto-scaling groups and load balancers if needed.

3. Kubernetes for Scaling
  
  Why Kubernetes? Kubernetes is a powerful tool for orchestrating containerized applications, especially for scaling. Once you have Dockerized your applications, Kubernetes can help manage, deploy, and scale your containers across a cluster of machines.

  Next Steps:

    Set up Kubernetes Cluster: You can use AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to run Kubernetes in the cloud, which is fully managed and scales automatically.

    Define Kubernetes Manifests: Write Kubernetes deployment YAML files for your frontend and backend apps, defining the number of replicas, resource limits, and environment variables.

    Helm: You can use Helm for managing Kubernetes applications. It simplifies deploying and maintaining your services and dependencies.

    Scaling: Once you have your Kubernetes cluster set up, scaling will become easy, as you can adjust the number of replicas for your services based on demand.

Summary of Steps:

Docker: Containerize your frontend and backend applications.

Terraform: Use Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.).

Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster (likely using AWS EKS) and configure scaling for both frontend and backend apps.

Additional Considerations:

CI/CD: As part of production readiness, you should look into implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate deployments. You can use tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins for this purpose.

Monitoring and Logging: In production, you’ll need monitoring and logging to ensure everything is running smoothly. Consider integrating with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog for monitoring, and use ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch for logging.

Security: Ensure that your application follows security best practices such as using HTTPS, secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., environment variables), and configuring proper IAM roles and security groups in AWS.

Does this sound like a good plan to you? If you need more details or help with any specific step, feel free to ask!
