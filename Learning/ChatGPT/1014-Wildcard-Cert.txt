I have a system set up with vue.js and express.js under an nginx reverse proxy on my local system where the domain prosaurus.com is pointed at my computer via DNS.  This system also has a certificate through lets encrypt setup and everything works correctly if i go to https://prosaurus.com It properly shows my site with a valid certificate.

I would like this to also work for any third or fourth level domains so for example https://dcaley.prosaurus.com or https://docker.dcaley.prosaurus.com.  Currently it does not work that way.  What do i need to do?

ChatGPT said:

To allow your subdomains (third-level, fourth-level, etc.) like dcaley.prosaurus.com and docker.dcaley.prosaurus.com to work, you need to ensure the following:

DNS Wildcard Setup: Ensure that your DNS is configured to allow wildcard subdomains for your domain prosaurus.com. This means adding a wildcard A or CNAME record that will direct all subdomains to your server.

For example:

Add an A record like this:

  *.prosaurus.com -> [Your Server's IP Address]

Or if using a CNAME:

  *.prosaurus.com -> prosaurus.com

This will ensure that any subdomain under prosaurus.com will resolve to your server.


------- Here is a completely different ChatGPT session becuase i asked a question ---------------

What is the difference between a DNS A record and a CNAME record?

ChatGPT said:

The main difference between a DNS A record and a CNAME record lies in what they point to and how they are used:

A Record (Address Record):

  Purpose: It maps a domain name (e.g., example.com) directly to an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).

  Example: If you set an A record for example.com to 192.0.2.1, whenever someone types example.com, their browser will be directed to the IP address 192.0.2.1.

  Use: A records are used to map a domain name to a server's IP address.

CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record):

  Purpose: It maps a domain name to another domain name rather than an IP address. Essentially, it's an alias for another domain.

  Example: If you set a CNAME record for www.example.com to example.com, whenever someone goes to www.example.com, they will be directed to the IP address that example.com resolves to.

  Use: CNAME records are used for aliasing one domain name to another, like redirecting www to the non-www version of your site or pointing a subdomain to another domain.

Key Differences:

A Record points directly to an IP address, while a CNAME Record points to another domain name.

A Record is typically used for the root domain (e.g., example.com), while a CNAME Record is used for subdomains (e.g., www.example.com).

CNAME Records cannot be used for the root domain (because DNS specifications prohibit it) — only for subdomains.

In summary, an A record maps a domain to an IP address, and a CNAME record maps a domain to another domain.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NGINX Configuration: Your NGINX reverse proxy needs to be configured to handle requests for these wildcard subdomains. You'll need to modify your NGINX server block to handle these dynamically.

You can do this by setting up a server_name with a wildcard. Here's an example of a configuration for prosaurus.com to support all subdomains:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name *.prosaurus.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Or wherever your Express app is running
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }

The server_name *.prosaurus.com; ensures that NGINX accepts any subdomain of prosaurus.com.

Similarly, if you're using HTTPS, you'll want to ensure that the SSL configuration also allows wildcard subdomains:

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name *.prosaurus.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/prosaurus.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/prosaurus.com/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }

This configuration makes sure that NGINX will proxy any request from a subdomain to your Express.js server.

SSL Certificate for Wildcard Subdomains: The crucial part here is making sure your SSL certificate supports wildcard subdomains. Let's Encrypt supports wildcard certificates, but they require DNS-based validation.

Here's how you can issue a wildcard certificate for prosaurus.com:

Use Certbot with the DNS challenge to request a wildcard certificate. You can run:

  certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns -d "*.prosaurus.com" -d "prosaurus.com"

This will generate the SSL certificate for prosaurus.com and all its subdomains.

After this, Certbot will provide you with certificates that include wildcard subdomains, and you can configure NGINX to use those certificates as shown in the previous example.

Restart NGINX: After making the above changes to your NGINX configuration, don't forget to restart the NGINX service to apply them:

  sudo systemctl restart nginx

Summary of Steps:

DNS: Set up a wildcard DNS entry like *.prosaurus.com pointing to your server.

NGINX: Modify the server_name to accept all subdomains and proxy requests appropriately.

SSL Certificate: Obtain a wildcard SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt using DNS validation.

Restart NGINX: Restart NGINX to apply the changes.

Once these steps are done, any subdomain under prosaurus.com should be served correctly with HTTPS and the valid SSL certificate.


You said:

One caveat i failed to mention.  I only want the 'dcaley' third level domain to point at my server.  in the future there will be other third level domains which will point to other servers 

ChatGPT said:

Got it! Since you only want specific third-level domains like dcaley.prosaurus.com to point to your server, while leaving others to point to different servers, you'll need to adjust both your DNS configuration and NGINX setup accordingly.

Step-by-Step Solution:

DNS Configuration:

You'll want to ensure that dcaley.prosaurus.com is directed to your server, but other third-level domains should not be handled by your server unless you specifically configure them.

For dcaley.prosaurus.com (and any other third-level domains you want to point to this server), you should create individual DNS records:

  A Record for dcaley.prosaurus.com:

Point this subdomain to your server's IP address:

  dcaley.prosaurus.com -> [Your Server's IP Address]

For any future third-level domains, such as otherdomain.prosaurus.com, you'll need to add separate DNS entries for them pointing to their respective servers.

This way, only dcaley.prosaurus.com resolves to your server, while others can point to different servers based on their DNS configuration.

NGINX Configuration:

You don't need a wildcard entry here since you're only interested in specific third-level domains pointing to your server. You can configure your NGINX server to specifically handle requests for dcaley.prosaurus.com, and possibly other subdomains you might add in the future. For example:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name dcaley.prosaurus.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Or wherever your Express app is running
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name dcaley.prosaurus.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/prosaurus.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/prosaurus.com/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }

In this example, NGINX will only accept traffic from dcaley.prosaurus.com and proxy it to your Express.js app. If in the future you want to handle other third-level domains on this server, you can simply add additional server blocks for each one, such as:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name otherdomain.prosaurus.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://another-server-ip:3000;  # Point to a different server if needed
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }

SSL Certificates: You’ll need to ensure that your SSL certificate covers dcaley.prosaurus.com and any other subdomains you plan to serve from this server.

For a specific subdomain (e.g., dcaley.prosaurus.com), you can either:

  Use a certificate issued for dcaley.prosaurus.com alone.

  Use a wildcard certificate (like *.prosaurus.com) that will cover all subdomains under prosaurus.com.

If you're using Let's Encrypt, you can request certificates for specific subdomains like this:

  certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns -d "dcaley.prosaurus.com" -d "prosaurus.com"

This ensures that your subdomain dcaley.prosaurus.com has a valid certificate for HTTPS.

Restart NGINX: Once you've made the changes to both your DNS and NGINX configuration, restart NGINX to apply the changes:

  sudo systemctl restart nginx

Summary of Changes:

DNS:
Set a DNS A record for dcaley.prosaurus.com to point to your server.
Set separate DNS records for any other subdomains you want to point to different servers.

NGINX:
Configure a specific server block for dcaley.prosaurus.com.
Add future server blocks for other subdomains if needed.

SSL Certificates:
Ensure the SSL certificate includes dcaley.prosaurus.com (and others as necessary).

Restart NGINX:
Restart the NGINX service to apply all changes.

This setup will allow dcaley.prosaurus.com (and potentially other subdomains you configure in the future) to point to your server, while other subdomains (e.g., otherdomain.prosaurus.com) can point to different servers.
