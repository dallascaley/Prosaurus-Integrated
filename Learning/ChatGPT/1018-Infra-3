I think what is confusing me here is that you are asking me to provide my kubernetes cluster information for a remote execution, but such a cluster does not exist yet.  All i have created (or attempted to create) so far remotely is an EC2 instance

Ah, I see the source of the confusion! You're right in pointing out that you're still in the process of setting up your Kubernetes cluster and haven't created one yet. The Kubernetes provider configuration in Terraform assumes that you already have a working Kubernetes cluster to connect to, which is why it's causing issues in the remote execution environment right now.

Here’s the key issue: The error you're facing with the Kubernetes provider is due to the fact that you're trying to apply Kubernetes configurations without a Kubernetes cluster being set up yet. In other words, you're trying to interact with Kubernetes resources (like deployments, services, etc.) on a cluster that doesn't exist yet, which is why the provider can't find the ~/.kube/config file.

Let’s walk through how to properly approach this situation. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. You need to have a Kubernetes cluster running first.

Since you're working with EC2 instances and not EKS (as you mentioned), you’ll need to create your own Kubernetes cluster on top of the EC2 instances. Once that Kubernetes cluster is set up and running, you’ll be able to use the kubectl configuration (i.e., ~/.kube/config) to interact with it and deploy your workloads.

2. Steps for setting up Kubernetes on EC2:

If you're using EC2 instances to set up a Kubernetes cluster, you can do it manually (or with tools like kubeadm, kops, or even using terraform scripts for automation). Below are the steps you would follow to set up the Kubernetes cluster on EC2:

Step 1: Launch EC2 instances (already done in your Terraform script).
You’ve already defined an EC2 instance in Terraform with the aws_instance resource. This instance can serve as part of your Kubernetes cluster.

Step 2: Install Kubernetes on the EC2 instances.
After the EC2 instance(s) are launched, you need to manually (or using automation) install Kubernetes components (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, etc.) on those instances.

You could use a tool like kubeadm to set up a Kubernetes master and worker nodes.

Step 3: Set up the Kubernetes cluster.
After installing Kubernetes on your EC2 instances, you'll use kubeadm init on the master node to initialize the cluster, then join worker nodes using kubeadm join from the worker nodes.

Once the cluster is initialized, Kubernetes will generate the kubeconfig file (~/.kube/config) that contains information on how to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

Step 4: Access the kubeconfig.
Once your Kubernetes cluster is running, the kubeconfig file will be generated. This file contains the necessary information (such as the API server URL, authentication details, etc.) for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl or Terraform.

Step 5: Use the kubeconfig in Terraform.
Now that your Kubernetes cluster is set up, you can use the kubeconfig file to configure the Terraform Kubernetes provider by either referencing it directly (as you were originally doing) or setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

3. But What If I Don’t Want to Set Up a Full Kubernetes Cluster Manually?

If you want to avoid manually setting up Kubernetes on EC2 instances and would rather automate the process, here are two popular options:

Kops: An easier way to set up a Kubernetes cluster on EC2 instances. kops simplifies the creation of a highly available Kubernetes cluster.

kubeadm: If you prefer a more hands-on approach, kubeadm is a tool for setting up Kubernetes on existing EC2 instances.

Once the Kubernetes cluster is up and running, Terraform can be used to configure Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, etc.) on the cluster.

4. What You’re Missing:

Your Terraform code currently assumes that a Kubernetes cluster is already present and that you have a valid kubeconfig file to authenticate against the cluster. Since you're still in the process of setting up the cluster (or don't have it set up yet), Terraform cannot interact with Kubernetes resources at this time because there is no running cluster to connect to.

Suggested Approach:
Create EC2 instances (you've done this part already with the aws_instance resource).

Set up Kubernetes on these EC2 instances using kubeadm, kops, or another automation tool.

Ensure that Kubernetes is properly running on your EC2 instances, and obtain the kubeconfig file.

Once the Kubernetes cluster is running, update your Terraform Kubernetes provider configuration to use the correct kubeconfig file (via config_path or KUBECONFIG environment variable).

Deploy your applications using Kubernetes resources in Terraform (as you're currently doing with kubernetes_deployment, kubernetes_service, etc.).

Conclusion:

The reason your Kubernetes provider block is not working now is that the Kubernetes cluster isn't set up yet. Terraform can't interact with Kubernetes resources without a functioning cluster to connect to. The next steps are to set up Kubernetes on your EC2 instances (either manually or via automation), get your kubeconfig file, and then update your Terraform code to use that configuration to deploy your resources.

If you need help with setting up the Kubernetes cluster itself, I can guide you through the process of using kubeadm or kops to do that! Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
